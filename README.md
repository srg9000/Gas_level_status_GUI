# Gas_level_status_GUI
This is a desktop GUI that shows current status of gas concentration by reading the data from a database. This is a simulation, the data is generated randomly and inserted in the database for some time. The GUI has a current status page(safe or unsafe state) and a plot for showing the concentration levels.
